# Terms and Conditions

_Last updated: 2025-10-21_

These Terms govern your access to and use of the **Panthart** marketplace (the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

---

## 1. Eligibility & Acceptance
- You must have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms and comply with the laws of your jurisdiction.  
- By connecting a wallet or interacting with any Panthart smart contract, you accept these Terms.

## 2. Non-Custodial Service & Wallet Responsibility
- Panthart is a UI that surfaces actions on **non-custodial** smart contracts.  
- You control your wallet and private keys. **You are solely responsible** for safeguarding them and for all on-chain actions taken by your address.  
- Lost keys, seed phrases, or mis-signed transactions cannot be reversed by Panthart.

<Callout type="warning">
All on-chain transactions are final once confirmed. Always verify contract addresses and spenders before approving.
</Callout>

## 3. Fees & Pricing
- **Marketplace fee:** **2.5%** of each secondary sale. Of this, **1.5%** is routed to the **Reward Distributor** for Non-Fungible Comrades holders and **1%** to the Panthart fee wallet.  
- **Creation fee:** may apply for creator workflows and covers IPFS pinning/bandwidth and convenience services. Creation fees are displayed in-product **before** confirmation, are **separate** from marketplace and royalty fees, and are paid at creation time.  
- **Dynamic pricing:** Fees are **not fixed** and may change over time due to market conditions, network costs, or service improvements. Changes are reflected in the UI prior to confirmation.

## 4. Multi-Currency & Gas
- Listings and settlements occur in the **listing currency** (ETN or supported ERC-20).  
- Network **gas fees** are paid by you to miners/validators and are **non-refundable**.  
- Failed or reverted transactions may still consume gas.

## 5. Royalties
- Where a collection has a royalty policy, royalties are honored by the marketplace contracts during settlement.  
- Royalties on other marketplaces or peer-to-peer transfers are outside Panthart’s control and are **not guaranteed chain-wide**.

## 6. Content, Metadata & IPFS
- You are responsible for **all content** you upload or pin (media, metadata, descriptions, links).  
- IPFS pinning is provided on a **best-effort** basis; long-term availability is not guaranteed.  
- You represent that your content does not infringe others’ rights and complies with applicable law.

<Callout type="info">
Immutable, content-addressed URIs (CIDs) improve provenance but do not guarantee perpetual availability or legal compliance.
</Callout>

## 7. Prohibited Activities
You agree **not** to use Panthart for:
- Illegal content or activity; infringement; defamation; malicious code.  
- Market manipulation, wash trading, spoofing, front-running, or sybil abuse.  
- Circumventing royalties or protocol fees through deceitful means.  
- Attempts to breach, overload, or interfere with the Service or its smart contracts.

Panthart may restrict UI access or take other reasonable measures to protect users and the protocol.

## 8. Smart-Contract & Protocol Risks
- Smart contracts can contain bugs, be upgraded, paused, or replaced subject to protocol governance.  
- Chain reorganizations, RPC outages, indexer delays, or third-party service failures can affect UI state (but not on-chain truth).  
- You acknowledge these risks and agree that you **use the Service at your own risk**.

## 9. No Warranty; Limitation of Liability
- The Service is provided **“as is” and “as available”** without warranties of any kind, express or implied.  
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, Panthart disclaims liability for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill.  
- In all cases, Panthart’s aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater of (a) the amounts you paid to Panthart for the Service in the 3 months preceding the claim, or (b) USD $100.

## 10. Taxes
- You are responsible for any **taxes** arising from your use of the Service, including sales, use, VAT, income, or other applicable taxes.

## 11. Takedowns & Complaints
- If you believe content infringes your rights or violates law, request moderation by contacting us via the official channels listed in **Section 14** with supporting information (links, token IDs, proofs).  
- Panthart may remove or limit UI access to reported content where appropriate. On-chain data is not erasable by Panthart.

## 12. Third-Party Services
- The Service may link to or rely on third parties (wallet providers, RPCs, IPFS pinning, Cloudinary, etc.). Panthart is **not responsible** for third-party services and does not control their availability or terms.

## 13. Changes to the Service & Terms
- Panthart may update features, fees, or policies to improve the Service or respond to market and security conditions.  
- Panthart may modify these Terms; continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. The “Last updated” date will reflect the most recent revision.

## 14. Contact & Support
For support, security disclosures, or takedown requests, reach us through our official channels:
- **Telegram:** https://t.me/DecentroneumGroupChat  
- **X (Twitter):** https://x.com/decentroneum

> Do **not** share seed phrases or private keys. We will never ask for them.

## 15. Governing Law; Disputes
- These Terms are governed by applicable law determined by Panthart’s place of operation, unless mandatory law provides otherwise.  
- Any dispute shall be resolved in a competent court of that venue, unless the parties agree to alternative dispute resolution. You and Panthart agree to pursue good-faith resolution prior to filing.

## 16. Termination
- You may stop using the UI at any time. On-chain contracts remain accessible via other interfaces.  
- Panthart may suspend or restrict UI access for violations of these Terms or to protect users and the protocol.

## 17. Miscellaneous
- **Severability:** If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.  
- **No waiver:** Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.  
- **Entire agreement:** These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Panthart regarding the Service.

By continuing to use Panthart, you acknowledge these Terms and agree to act responsibly on-chain and in our community.
