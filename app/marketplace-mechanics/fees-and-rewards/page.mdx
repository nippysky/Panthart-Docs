# Fees & Rewards

Panthart charges **2.5%** per trade and splits automatically at settlement:
- **1.5% → Reward Distributor** (claimable by **Non-Fungible Comrades** holders)
- **1.0% → Panthart Fee Wallet**

<FeeCalculator />

## Formula

Let `T` = trade amount (ETN/ETH equivalent). Then:
- `fee = T × 0.025`
- `rewards = T × 0.015`
- `panthart = T × 0.010`
- `seller_receives = T − fee`

**Example**: `T = 100` → `fee = 2.5`, `rewards = 1.5`, `panthart = 1.0`, `seller_receives = 97.5`.

## Edge cases

- **Canceled listings/auctions:** no fee is charged.
- **Failed settlement:** no fee is charged; listing remains or is marked failed.
- **Refunds:** if a refund occurs off-chain, on-chain fee transfers are not reverted.
- **Rounding:** fees are computed in base units; minor rounding may occur on dust values.

<Callout type="info">
Rewards accrue continuously and are claimable **on demand** by holders. Distribution is proportional to the number of Comrades held at claim time or as defined by the contract logic.
