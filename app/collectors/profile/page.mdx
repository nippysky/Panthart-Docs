# Profile

Your profile is your hub: identity, portfolio, rewards, and balances—fully non-custodial and on-chain.

> **Heads-up:** Connect a wallet on **Electroneum EVM** to unlock profile editing, rewards, and withdrawals.

---

## Identity

Customize your public presence:

- **Username** — set a human-readable handle (unique).  
- **Avatar** — square image, tuned for dark/light themes.  
- **Banner** — wide cover image for your profile header.  
- **Bio & links** — add a short bio and optional links (website, Telegram, X).

> Your wallet remains the owner of the profile. Switching wallets shows the connected wallet’s profile.

---

## Portfolio

Everything you own and list in one place:

- **Owned NFTs** — filter by **ERC-721** / **ERC-1155**, collection, and status.  
- **On sale** — items you’ve listed at fixed price, with quick “Edit / Cancel” actions.  
- **Multi-currency** — pricing token visible on each listing (ETN or approved ERC-20).

**Browse fixed-price:** [panth.art/listings](https://panth.art/listings)

---

## Rewards (Non-Fungible Comrades)

If you hold **Non-Fungible Comrades**, your profile shows a **Rewards** panel:

- **Accrued rewards** — your pro-rata share of the **1.5%** marketplace fee pool.  
- **Distribution history** — past payouts with on-chain tx links.  
- **Eligibility** — snapshot logic is automatic; holding more Comrades increases your share.

> Rewards are routed by the **Reward Distributor** contract and remain fully on-chain for transparency.

---

## Balances & Withdrawals

All balances related to auctions and offers, in one place:

- **Auction refunds** — if you’re **outbid**, your escrowed amount becomes withdrawable here (auto-released by contract; the panel surfaces it immediately).  
- **Offer escrow** — cancel an open offer to release escrow; settled/expired offers show their final state.  
- **Token approvals** — see which ERC-20 tokens you’ve approved for spending and revoke in your wallet if needed.

**Tip:** For performance, balances may cache for a few seconds—refresh if you just completed a transaction.

---

## Selling quick actions

From your profile you can:

- **List** an owned NFT at fixed price.  
- **Start an auction** with reserve price and duration.  
- **Batch-list** (where supported) for multiple editions of an **ERC-1155**.

> Fees are settled at sale: **2.5% marketplace** (1.5% → reward pool, 1% → Panthart), plus any creator royalty configured by the collection.

---

## Settings & Security

- **Connected wallet** — displays the active address and chain.  
- **Session safety** — the UI never asks for a seed phrase. If any site does, leave immediately.  
- **Approvals** — first-time ERC-20 spend requires a one-time **approve**. Always verify the **spender** is the official marketplace contract (see **References → Contract Addresses**).

---

## Notifications (optional)

- **In-app toasts** — purchases completed, bids placed/outbid/won, listing updates.  
- **Telegram/X** — follow announcements and AMAs for feature launches and maintenance windows.

See **About → Contact** for public channels and how to reach admins securely.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **“Can’t edit profile.”** Make sure your wallet is connected to **Electroneum EVM** and the site can read your address.  
- **“My bid refund isn’t visible yet.”** It’s auto-released by the contract when you’re outbid. If your wallet UI lags, refresh; then check **Balances & Withdrawals**.  
- **“Approval keeps popping up.”** You’re switching tokens/currency. Approvals are **per token**; approve once per ERC-20.  
- **“Wrong currency on a listing.”** Listings show the pricing token—switch your checkout currency to match.
