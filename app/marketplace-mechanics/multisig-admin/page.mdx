# Multisig Admin

Panthart’s protocol controls are secured by a **2-of-N multi-signature wallet**.  
Two independent signatures are required for any admin transaction to execute on **Electroneum EVM**.

<Callout type="info">
The multisig is the sole authority for protocol-level changes. No single EOA can alter fees, pause flows, or move treasury funds.
</Callout>

## Scope of control

- **Marketplace parameters** — fee basis points and destination wallets used at settlement.
- **Reward Distributor** — configuration governing distribution windows and funding (where applicable).
- **Drops / pausable modules** — pause/unpause capability for sensitive flows exposed by contracts.
- **Treasury movements** — protocol revenue transfers in **ETN** and supported **ERC-20** tokens.
- **Stolen NFTs Flagging** — Flag and pause trade if a collection or an NFT item is reported and confirmed for fraudulent activity.

All target contracts and addresses are listed in **References → [Contract Addresses](/references/contract-addresses)**.

## Threshold & signer set

- **Threshold:** **2 signatures** required to authorize and execute any admin call.
- **Signers:** a small, hardware-backed set maintained by the core team; membership and threshold changes are executed via the same multisig.

The threshold supports signer availability while preserving separation of duties.

---

## Operational model

- **Proposal & review:** admin calls are prepared off-chain and reviewed by a second signer prior to submission.
- **Simulation:** calldata is simulated against current state before execution to confirm effects and gas bounds.
- **Execution:** once two signatures are recorded on the multisig, the transaction is dispatched on-chain.
- **Verification:** post-execution, emitted events and updated storage are checked and recorded.

Each change is tied to an internal ticket and produces an auditable chain of evidence: proposal, calldata, signatures, transaction hash, and verification notes.

---

## Logging & auditability

- **Change log:** timestamp, target contract, function signature, parameters (units/decimals), signers, and transaction hash.
- **Provenance:** links to explorer verification and any relevant PRDs or internal docs.
- **Public transparency:** material updates (e.g., fee changes, pause windows) are summarized in the Governance section.

---

## Incident posture

- **Containment capability:** pausable modules allow fast containment of risky paths while keeping read-only surfaces available.
- **Recovery readiness:** signer rotation (add/remove) and threshold adjustments are supported by the same 2-of-N framework.
- **Reconciliation:** indexers and jobs reconcile state after any administrative action to ensure UI and caches reflect on-chain truth.

---

## Reliability guarantees

- **Non-custodial control:** the multisig authorizes configuration; settlement and payouts remain fully on-chain and atomic.
- **Deterministic outcomes:** all admin effects are enforced by contracts, observable via events, and repeatable under simulation.
- **Least privilege in practice:** no user asset custody, no back-door transfers; only the documented admin surfaces are exposed.
