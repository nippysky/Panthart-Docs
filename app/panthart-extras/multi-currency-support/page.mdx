# Multi-Currency Trading (Token Integrations)

Enable your community to trade on Panthart using **your own ERC-20 token**, alongside native **ETN**.  
Panthart‚Äôs marketplace is built with a currency whitelist‚Äîonce approved, your token becomes selectable in **Listings** and **Auctions** across the app.

---

## Status & pricing

- **Available today:** **ETN (native)** only.  
- **Coming soon:** third-party **ERC-20** tokens via integration requests.
- **One-time integration fee:** **$2,500 worth of DCNT** (Panthart‚Äôs native token) ‚Äî payable **after DCNT launch**.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚è≥">
Until DCNT is launched, token integration requests are **wait-listed**. You can submit interest, but payment and activation happen **post-launch**.
</Callout>

## What ‚Äúintegration‚Äù means (under the hood)

Panthart‚Äôs marketplace contract maintains a **currency allowlist**:
- `currencyAllowed[address(0)] = true` ‚Üí **ETN** is always supported.
- Additional **ERC-20** tokens are toggled **on/off** by Panthart ops.

Once your ERC-20 is allowed:
- **Listings** can be created with your token as the settlement currency.
- **Auctions** can accept bids in your token, with min increments and **snipe extension** logic maintained.
- **Royalties (ERC-2981)**, **market fees**, and **seller proceeds** are paid in the **same currency** (native or ERC-20).
- If a payout transfer fails (e.g., ERC-20 returns `false`), the contract credits the recipient‚Äôs **balance** for later withdrawal.

<Callout type="info" emoji="üß©">
For native ETN, buyers send value via <code>msg.value</code>.  
For ERC-20, buyers approve and the contract pulls funds via <code>transferFrom</code>.
</Callout>

## How trades settle (quick primer)

- **Royalties:** If the collection supports ERC-2981, the contract pays the creator‚Äôs royalty in the **listing currency**.
- **Marketplace fee:** a % of sale price (configurable, capped at 10%). Part of that fee is routed to a **rewards distributor**.
- **Seller proceeds:** Sale price ‚àí royalty ‚àí fee, paid in the same currency.
- **Anti-sniping (auctions):** last-minute bids extend the auction by a few minutes (configurable ‚Äúsnipe extension‚Äù).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="üõ°Ô∏è">
Panthart checks a **stolen asset registry** before allowing sales or settlement. Flagged tokens cannot be traded.
</Callout>

---

## Integration requirements

- Your token is an **ERC-20** deployed on the same EVM network as Panthart.
- Contract behaves per standard (`transfer`, `transferFrom` returning `bool` or empty success data).
- No fee-on-transfer behavior that would break exact accounting (if present, disclose during review).
- Team wallet able to pay **$2,500 worth of DCNT** (one-time) **after DCNT launch**.
- You agree to brand and listing guidelines to avoid user confusion.

## Submit your token (post-launch flow)

<Steps>

### 1) Request integration
Provide token contract address, token name/symbol, decimals, links (site, docs, audit if any), and primary contact.

### 2) Technical & policy review
We validate standard ERC-20 behavior and run marketplace compatibility checks.

### 3) Pay the one-time fee (DCNT)
After DCNT is live, settle **$2,500 worth of DCNT** to the integration address shown in the UI.

### 4) Allowlist & go-live
Panthart toggles your token **allowed**. Creators can now choose it for **Listings** and **Auctions**.

### 5) Educate your community
Share a short guide: approving spend (for buyers), choosing currency (for sellers), and how royalties/fees settle in-currency.

</Steps>

## Using your token on the marketplace

**For sellers**
- When creating a listing/auction, pick your token in **Currency**.
- Set price/start price in **token units**.
- For ERC-1155, quantity must be > 0; for ERC-721, quantity is always 1.
- If you cancel or an auction ends with no winner, assets are returned from escrow.

**For buyers/bidders**
- **ETN**: send `msg.value == price` (listings) or ‚â• required bid (auctions).
- **ERC-20**: approve the marketplace for the **exact amount** then purchase/bid.
- If outbid in an ERC-20 auction, your previous bid is added to your **credits** for withdrawal.

## FAQ

**Can we integrate before DCNT launches?**  
No. You can **register interest**, but activation happens **after** DCNT goes live and the fee can be paid.

**Where is the fee stored and how is value calculated?**  
Panthart admin after reach out will use prevailing market value of the DCNT amount equivalent to **$2,500** at the time of payment and provide the settlement address.

**Can we change or remove our token later?**  
Panthart can disable a token (e.g., security concerns). Existing orders/auctions will be respected or canceled per policy.


**Are royalties paid in our token too?**  
Yes‚Äîroyalties, marketplace fees, and seller proceeds all settle in the **listing currency**.
