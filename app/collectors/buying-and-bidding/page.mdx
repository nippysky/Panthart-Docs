# Buying & Bidding

<Callout type="warning">
Verify you’re on **Electroneum EVM** and using official contracts from  
**References → [Contract Addresses](/references/contract-addresses)**.  
If a wallet prompt shows an unexpected **spender** or **contract**, **cancel**.
</Callout>

Buying on Panthart is non-custodial: your wallet signs, the marketplace settles on-chain,
and transfers/fees/royalties are performed atomically.

---

## Currencies & approvals

Panthart supports **ETN** (native) and selected **ERC-20** tokens.

- **ETN:** pay directly; confirm the single purchase/bid tx.
- **ERC-20:** the first time you use a token, your wallet asks to **approve** the marketplace as spender  
  (one-time allowance per token), then you confirm the buy/bid.

> You can switch currency before confirming. If a listing is priced in a specific token, the UI will ask you to use it.

  <Tabs.Tab>
  ## Fixed price (instant buy)

  1. Open the item → review **metadata**, **royalty note**, and **currency**.  
  2. Click **Buy now**. If using an ERC-20 for the first time, confirm the **approval**; then confirm the **purchase**.  
  3. Settlement executes atomically:
     - NFT transfers to your wallet  
     - Seller proceeds + creator royalty (if any) are paid  
     - **2.5%** marketplace fee is collected (**1.5% → Reward Distributor**, **1% → Panthart**)

  **Browse fixed-price:** [panth.art/listings](https://panth.art/listings)

  <Callout>
    **ERC-1155 editions:** when available, select **quantity** before buying. Per-wallet caps (if set) are enforced.

  ## Auctions (timed, on-chain)

  - **Format:** English-style timed auctions with on-chain min increment and optional anti-sniping extension.  
  - **Place a bid:** value ≥ current bid + min increment (and ≥ reserve if set).  
  - **Escrow:** your bid is escrowed in the marketplace contract; if outbid, it’s **released automatically**.  
  - **Win:** when the timer ends, settlement transfers the NFT and distributes funds/fees atomically.

## What you’ll see in wallet prompts

- **Buy now:** a single **contract call** with the total in your chosen currency.  
- **First-time ERC-20:** an **approve** call (spender = marketplace contract), then the buy/bid call.  
- **Auction bid:** a **bid** call that escrows the amount.  
- **Outbid release:** automatic; no signature required.

---

## Fees, royalties, and rewards

- **Marketplace fee:** **2.5%** of the final sale  
  - **1.5% → Reward Distributor** (to Non-Fungible Comrades holders)  
  - **1% → Panthart fee wallet**
- **Royalties (optional):** honored per collection policy at settlement time.  
- **Gas:** low on Electroneum EVM; paid by the actor who triggers the action (buyer for buy/bid, seller for list/cancel).

> For exact numbers on any trade amount, use the **Fee Calculator** on the docs homepage.

## Safety checklist

- Match contract addresses with **References → [Contract Addresses](/references/contract-addresses)**.  
- For ERC-20 approvals, confirm the **spender** is the marketplace contract.  
- Prefer **verified collections** and inspect the explorer link on the item page.  
- Never share seed phrases or sign blind messages in DMs.

## Troubleshooting

**“Insufficient funds / gas.”** Top up ETN or the selected ERC-20 and retry.  
**“Approval required / failed.”** Approve the token once; if it fails, check allowance in your wallet, then try again.  
**“Tx pending.”** Open the tx from the item page and wait for finality; some wallets let you bump fee.  
**“Currency mismatch.”** Listings show pricing currency; switch your checkout token or filter by token on marketplace pages.
