# Media & Metadata

Great NFTs start with clean media and predictable metadata. Panthart makes the pinning easy and keeps the rules simple—so creators of any level can launch confidently.

<Callout>
Panthart pins files to **IPFS** during creation (via our managed pinning). We strongly recommend **immutable URIs** (content-addressed CIDs) for long-term trust and provenance.
</Callout>

## Supported media (image / animation / audio)

Panthart accepts all common formats used in EVM NFT ecosystems.

- **Images** — `PNG`, `JPEG/JPG`, `WEBP`, **`GIF`** (animated).  
  **Targets:** square masters **1200×1200** or **1600×1600**. Lossless (PNG/WebP-lossless) recommended for pixel art; high-quality JPEG/WebP for photos/illustration.
- **Video** — `MP4`, `WEBM`, `MOV` (H.264/AAC or VP9/Opus recommended). Include a static `image` preview even if you use `animation_url`.
- **Audio** — `MP3`, `OGG`, `WAV`. Include **cover art** via the `image` field.
- **Large assets** — prefer compressed, streaming-friendly encodes for smooth on-chain UX (short playback starts quickly; full quality loads progressively).

> Animated **GIF** is supported, but for long/large loops consider **MP4/WEBM** for better compression.

## The metadata contract (ERC-721 / ERC-1155)

Panthart follows the de-facto ERC metadata shape used across marketplaces:

- **Required (practical)**: `name`, `description`, `image`  
- **Common optional**: `animation_url`, `external_url`, `background_color`  
- **Traits**: `attributes` (array of typed traits: string, numeric, or date)  
- **Royalties (legacy/OpenSea fields)**: `seller_fee_basis_points`, `fee_recipient`  
  - `seller_fee_basis_points: 500` means **5%** royalty to `fee_recipient`.

**Standards note:** Royalties are ultimately enforced by marketplace policy at settlement time. The fields above communicate intent to explorers and UIs.

## File naming & folder layout (important)

Panthart’s creator flow accepts bulk folders and handles pinning. To keep everything aligned:

**For 721 (one file per token):**


- **Each `metadata/*.json` filename must match its asset name** (`1.json` ↔ `1.png`).  
- The `image` (and `animation_url`, if present) will point to the matching pinned asset.

**For 1155 editions (shared metadata):**

- You may use **one metadata** file for all editions (shared `name`/`image`/`attributes`) and set **supply/editions** during creation.  
- Alternative mode: separate files per tokenId if your contract variant exposes distinct per-id URIs.

<Callout type="info">
<strong>Good practice:</strong> Keep all filenames <code>1..N</code> with no gaps. Use UTF-8 JSON (no BOM). Avoid spaces and special characters in filenames to make CID paths predictable.
</Callout>

## Example metadata (Comrades)

Below is a real-world style JSON for one Comrade.  
Notes inline after the code block.

```json copy
{
  "name": "Comrade #1",
  "description": "Meet Comrade #1. With a lime background, cream complexion, monkey jacket attire, tears eyes, brown papas cap head, bored mouth, this comrade is ready to turn your digital world into a playground of fun and flair.",
  "image": "ipfs://bafybeig6bo24gmw2zjrgjuxonp2h4nmibx5ado3agts4k6ynilp35scdrm/1.png",
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "BACKGROUND", "value": "Lime" },
    { "trait_type": "COMPLEXION", "value": "Cream" },
    { "trait_type": "ATTIRE", "value": "Monkey Jacket" },
    { "trait_type": "EYES", "value": "Tears" },
    { "trait_type": "HEAD", "value": "Brown Papas Cap" },
    { "trait_type": "MOUTH", "value": "Bored" }
  ],
  "fee_recipient": "0xe785e1f0F48ee8ac4553F39618e230D8cFf45Ba3",
  "seller_fee_basis_points": 500
