# About

Panthart is a creator-first NFT marketplace on **Electroneum EVM**. We make minting simple, trading fair, and rewards transparent—so artists focus on art, collectors on curation, and developers on shipping.

> **Fast chain. Tiny fees. Real rewards.**  
> Panthart supports **ERC-721** and **ERC-1155**, charges a flat **2.5%** marketplace fee, and routes **1.5%** of every trade to our **Reward Distributor** for **Non-Fungible Comrades** holders, with **1%** to the Panthart fee wallet.

## Why Electroneum?

Electroneum’s modern L1 fits NFT UX really well:

- **~5-second finality (IBFT)** → near-instant confirmations for mints, bids, and listings.  
- **Ultra-low gas (fractions of a cent)** → economical reveals, editions, and contract interactions.  
- **EVM-compatible** → standard Solidity toolchains and familiar ERC-721/1155 behavior.  
- **Energy-efficient / known validators** → low power profile with a straightforward trust model.

If your mental model is *“Ethereum apps, but with low fees and fast finality,”* you’ll feel at home here.
