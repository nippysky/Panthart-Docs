# Collections Management

Own a collection? This page covers **profile & branding**, **mint controls** (for Drops), **royalties**, **payouts**, and **safety**. Everything is **non-custodial** and enforced by the underlying contracts.

<Callout type="info">
To manage a collection, connect the **owner wallet** (or a wallet with delegated admin rights, where supported).  
If your project uses a **Multisig**, ensure enough signers are available for admin actions.
</Callout>

## Collection profile & branding

Keep your storefront crisp and trustworthy.

**Editable fields**
- **Name & symbol** — shown on item and collection pages.
- **Description** — short, scannable; include links to roadmap/whitepaper if relevant.
- **Logo (avatar)** — square, high-contrast works best in dark/light themes.
- **Cover image (banner)** — wide (hero) image for collection header.
- **Links** — website, X/Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and support docs.

**Good hygiene**
- Use consistent iconography between marketplace and socials.
- Keep the description factual (supply, mint policy, royalties, license).
- Verify your contract in the explorer and request **verified** status on the marketplace.

## Royalties & marketplace fees

- **Royalties (optional):** honored at settlement per the collection’s configured policy.  
- **Marketplace fee:** flat **2.5%** of the final sale — **1.5%** routed to the **Reward Distributor** (Non-Fungible Comrades holders), **1%** to the Panthart fee wallet.
- **Currencies:** sales can settle in **ETN** (native) or selected **ERC-20s**; proceeds and fee splits follow the listing’s currency.

> For buyers’ perspective and fee math examples, see **Collectors → [Buying & Bidding](/collectors/buying-bidding)** and the **Fee Calculator** on the docs homepage.

## 721 Drop controls (phased mint)

If your collection is a **Drop** (ERC-721), you’ll see phase controls and supply caps in the UI.

<Tabs items={['Setup', 'Presale/Allowlist', 'Public Mint']}>

  <Tabs.Tab>
  ## Setup

  <Steps>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Basics</strong> — name, symbol, max supply, base URI (placeholder if planning a reveal).</li>
      <li><strong>Branding</strong> — logo, banner, description, links.</li>
      <li><strong>Royalties</strong> — set policy according to your creator terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Admins</strong> — add maintainers (if your contract supports delegated roles).</li>
    </ol>
  </Steps>

  <Callout>
    Max supply and certain invariants may be <em>locked</em> on chain. Double-check before saving.
  </Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
  ## Presale / Allowlist

  <Steps>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Upload allowlist</strong> — CSV or Merkle root (per contract UX).</li>
      <li><strong>Window</strong> — open/close timestamps and price for allowlisted wallets.</li>
      <li><strong>Per-wallet cap</strong> — enforce fair distribution.</li>
    </ol>
  </Steps>

  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
  ## Public Mint

  <Steps>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Price & currency</strong> — ETN or a supported ERC-20.</li>
      <li><strong>Schedule</strong> — start time, optional end time.</li>
      <li><strong>Per-wallet cap</strong> — optional; great for anti-whale control.</li>
    </ol>
  </Steps>

  <Callout>
    For ERC-20 mints, buyers will see a one-time <em>Approve</em> prompt before the first purchase with that token.
  </Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Proceeds & withdrawals

On a Drop collection page, owners can withdraw **proceeds** that have accrued from on-chain mints and primary sales.

- **Owner check** — the connected wallet must be the collection **owner** (or a permitted payout role).  
- **Multi-currency** — proceeds withdraw in the **same currency** they were collected (ETN or the ERC-20 used).  
- **Explorer links** — every withdrawal shows a tx link for auditability.

<Callout type="warning">
If your project uses a <strong>Multisig</strong> for admin functions or treasury, make sure the withdraw call is made by the Multisig address and has the required signatures.
</Callout>

---

## Moderation & safety

- **Freeze / unfreeze (if supported)** — temporarily lock sensitive parameters during incident response.  
- **Blacklist / stolen registry (if present)** — integrate with your project’s stolen/flagged tokens policy.  
- **Verification** — request or maintain verified status; keep socials and site links in sync.

> Always cross-check contract addresses in **References → [Contract Addresses](/references/contract-addresses)** before executing admin actions.

---

## Troubleshooting

**“I can’t edit the collection.”**  
You’re not connected with the owner/admin wallet, or the contract is locked. Reconnect the correct wallet or switch to your Multisig.

**“Withdraw button is disabled.”**  
No proceeds are currently available, or you’re connected with a non-owner wallet.

**“Reveal didn’t update images.”**  
Your new base URI may not be reachable or the cache hasn’t refreshed yet. Verify the CID, then hard refresh; confirm the `tokenURI(tokenId)` on chain points to the new location.

**“Presale wallets rejected.”**  
The allowlist on chain doesn’t match your list. Re-generate proofs / Merkle root and update the config before reopening.
