# Feature Your Collection (Bidding)

Boost visibility across Panthart by winning the **Featured Collection** slot.  
Creators place **bids** to secure the next 28-day feature window. Highest bid at cycle end wins, and a new cycle starts immediately.

---

## How it works (overview)

- **Cycle length:** 28 days per feature window.
- **Eligibility:** you must be the **owner** of the collection (the connected wallet must own/deploy it).
- **Bidding:** start at the **minimum bid**; each new bid must be **strictly higher** than the current highest.
- **Top-ups:** you may **add** to your existing bid at any time to take the lead.
- **Winner selection:** when a cycle ends, the **highest bidder** is automatically featured across Panthart.
- **Auto-rollover:** a new 28-day cycle opens **immediately** after a winner is locked.
- **No-bid fallback:** if a cycle ends with **no bids**, the **Non-Fungible Comrades** collection is featured by default.

‚ÄúFeature‚Äù placement includes prominent spots across marketplace surfaces (home, explore, search highlights‚Äîand other curated rails as available). Exact placements may evolve, but the winner remains consistently highlighted for the entire 28-day period.

## Pre-flight checklist

- ‚úÖ Connected wallet matches the **collection owner**.  
- ‚úÖ Collection is **submitted** (select from your owned collections).  
- ‚úÖ You can meet or exceed the **minimum bid** for the current cycle.  
- ‚úÖ You understand the **cycle end time** and that a **higher** bid may overtake you before the deadline.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
Each new bid must be **greater than** the standing highest bid. If you‚Äôre outbid, your bid remains recorded for the cycle unless you top up again.

## Step-by-step

<Steps>

### 1) Connect & verify ownership
Connect your wallet. Pick a collection you **own**. The UI validates ownership before enabling bidding.

### 2) Submit collection & place the first bid
Enter the **minimum bid** or more to become the current leader. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### 3) Track the leaderboard
Watch the live leaderboard. If someone outbids you, use **Top up** to add funds and reclaim the lead.

### 4) Cycle ends ‚Üí winner is featured
At the 28-day cut-off, the **highest bidder** is locked in and automatically featured across Panthart for the next 28 days.

### 5) New cycle starts immediately
As soon as a cycle closes, a fresh 28-day cycle opens for the **next** featured slot. You can bid again at any time.

</Steps>

## Leaderboard & timing

- **Live status:** The bidding card shows the **current highest bid**, **leader collection**, and a **countdown** to cycle end.  
- **Timestamps:** All times are shown in your local timezone for clarity.  
- **Instant updates:** The board updates in real-time when bids are confirmed on-chain.

---

## Rules & edge cases

- **Higher-only bids:** Each incoming bid must be **strictly higher** than the current leader.  
- **Top-up logic:** Top-ups **increase** your existing bid; your new total must exceed the leader to take the top spot.  
- **No bids this cycle:** If the countdown hits zero with **no bids**, **Non-Fungible Comrades** is featured for that cycle.  
- **Auto-start next cycle:** The new bidding window opens **immediately** after the winner is finalized.  
- **Ownership check:** You can‚Äôt bid **for** a collection you don‚Äôt own with the connected wallet.
