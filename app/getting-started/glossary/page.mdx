# Glossary

A compact, no-handwaving reference for terms you’ll see around Panthart and Electroneum EVM.

---

## Core standards

**ERC-721** — NFT standard for **unique** tokens (1 token ID = 1 unique item). Great for 1/1 art and distinct collectibles.  
**ERC-1155** — Multi-token standard for **editions** (many owners share the same token ID) and semi-fungible items (passes, game items).  
**ETN** — Native currency of the Electroneum EVM network. Used for gas; can also be a listing/settlement currency.

---

## Minting & collections

**Drop (ERC-721 Drop)** — A phased mint for a collection (e.g., allowlist/presale → public mint → reveal). See **[Create → Collection (721 Drop)](/creators/create-nft/erc721-drop)**.  
**Single 721** — A true **1/1** with unique metadata. See **[Create → Single 721](/creators/create-nft/erc721-single)**.  
**Single 1155** — An **edition** (one token ID, many copies). See **[Create → Single 1155](/creators/create-nft/erc1155-single)**.  
**Max supply** — Hard cap for a token or collection; once reached, no further minting.  
**Allowlist** — A list of addresses allowed to mint early or at a special price/limit.  
**Reveal** — The switch from placeholder art/metadata to final on-chain/IPFS URIs.  
**Base URI** — Prefix used by contracts to construct metadata URLs (e.g., `ipfs://…/{id}.json`).  
**Provenance** — A cryptographic commitment to the final artwork order (optional, used by some collections to prove fairness).

## Marketplace & trading

**Fixed-price listing** — Buy now at a posted price; transfers on payment.  
**Auction** — Highest valid bid at end time wins; settlement transfers NFT and funds.  
**Reserve price** — Minimum price an auction must reach before it can settle to a bidder.  
**Bid increment** — Minimum step above the current highest bid.  
**Escrow** — Assets/funds held by the marketplace contract during listings/auctions to guarantee delivery at settlement.  
**Settlement** — The on-chain exchange of NFT ↔ currency after a sale/auction completes.  
**Delist** — Cancel a listing before it executes; returns the escrowed NFT to the owner.

---

## Fees, rewards, and royalties

**Marketplace fee** — **2.5%** per successful trade (split **1.5% → Rewards** and **1% → Panthart**). See **[Fees & Rewards](/marketplace-mechanics/fees-and-rewards)**.  
**Creation fee** — A small, upfront fee that covers **IPFS pinning/bandwidth** and creator-friendly services (uploads, validation).  
**Royalty** — A percentage of sale price that’s paid to the creator/recipient when supported by the marketplace.  
**Reward Distributor** — Contract that accumulates **1.5%** of every trade and lets **Non-Fungible Comrades** holders **claim** their share. See **[Reward Distributor](/marketplace-mechanics/reward-distributor)**.  
**Claim** — On-chain action where an eligible holder withdraws accrued rewards.

---

## Media & metadata

**IPFS** — Decentralized content storage; Panthart pins media/metadata for high availability.  
**Metadata (token)** — JSON describing an NFT (`name`, `description`, `image`, `animation_url`, `attributes`, royalties). See **[Media & Metadata](/creators/media-and-metadata)**.  
**Attributes / Traits** — Structured properties used for filtering and rarity (e.g., `{"trait_type":"Background","value":"Lime"}`).  
**Animation URL** — Optional link to video/audio/interactive media (e.g., MP4, WebM, GIF, HTML).

---

## Wallet & chain operations

**Approval** — A one-time permission that lets the marketplace transfer a token (NFT or ERC-20) for trading.  
**Permit / EIP-2612** — Signature-based ERC-20 approval flow; if a token supports it, approvals can be gas-optimized.  
**Gas** — Network fee paid in **ETN** for executing transactions.  
**Nonce** — Per-account transaction counter; mismatches can cause “nonce too high/low” errors (reset account to fix).  
**Signature** — Wallet-produced proof used in logins, allowlists, or off-chain authorizations.

---

## Security & governance

**Multisig** — Multi-signature wallet that authorizes sensitive admin changes. Panthart’s multisig requires **2 signatures** to execute. See **[Multisig Admin](/governance-and-policies/multisig-admin)**.  
**Verified address** — A contract address confirmed on the official explorer. Always cross-check with **[Contract Addresses](/references/contract-addresses)**.  
**Non-custodial** — You hold the keys; Panthart contracts move assets only with your on-chain approvals and signatures.

---

## Useful UI terms

**Floor price** — Lowest listing price in a collection.  
**Activity** — Recent sales/listings/bids (collection-level analytics).  
**Edition size** — Total number of copies for an ERC-1155 token ID.  
**Owner** — Current holder address of an NFT; “creator” is the original minter.
