# Collectors

Browse collections, place bids, or buy at fixed price. Your wallet stays in your control—Panthart is **non-custodial** and all settlement happens on-chain.

> TL;DR: Connect wallet → pick an item → buy or bid → the marketplace escrow contract handles the rest. Creator royalties (if present) and marketplace fees settle automatically at transfer.

## Before you buy

- **Wallet & network.** Use a modern EVM wallet (e.g., Rabby, MetaMask) connected to **Electroneum EVM**.  
- **Gas.** Network fees are low; you’ll see a small gas charge to approve tokens (first time) and to finalize a buy/bid.  
- **Storage.** Media and metadata live on IPFS/Arweave per collection policy; provenance events live on-chain.

---

## Finding items

- **Collections directory.** Filter by verified status, category, supply (721/1155), and floor price:  
  **Browse →** [panth.art/collections](https://panth.art/collections)  
- **Live auctions.** Sorted by ending soon / highest bid:  
  **Bid now →** [panth.art/auction](https://panth.art/auction)  
- **Fixed-price marketplace.** Everything instantly buyable:  
  **Shop →** [panth.art/listings](https://panth.art/listings)

---

## Buying at fixed price

1. Open the item page and review metadata, edition, and royalty note.  
2. Click **Buy now**, confirm the total (price + gas).  
3. Settlement routes: seller receives proceeds, creator royalty (if configured) is paid, and **2.5% marketplace fee** is collected (**1.5%** → Reward Distributor, **1%** → Panthart fee wallet).  
4. The NFT transfers to your wallet instantly after chain finality.

> First-time buyers may see an **approval** step (ERC-20 or WETH-style flows for certain listings). You’ll only do this once per token.

## Bidding in auctions

- **Format.** English-style timed auctions with on-chain increments and optional anti-sniping extension.  
- **Placing a bid.** Enter a value >= current bid + min increment. Your funds escrow in the marketplace contract.  
- **Outbid?** Your previous bid is released back to your wallet immediately.  
- **Win.** When the timer ends, the contract finalizes: NFT transfers to you; payouts and fees settle atomically.

> Watch the **ending soon** filter on the auctions page for last-minute opportunities:

## Offers (where supported)

- Make an **offer** below list price on eligible items or entire collections (floor offers).  
- Creators/sellers can accept from their dashboard; settlement mirrors a normal sale.  
- Expired or declined offers automatically release the escrow back to your wallet.

---

## Fees, rewards, and royalties

- **Marketplace fee:** **2.5%** of the final sale.  
  - **1.5%** flows to the **Reward Distributor** for Non-Fungible Comrades holders.  
  - **1%** flows to the **Panthart fee wallet**.  
- **Creator royalties (optional):** Honored at list/sale time per collection policy.  
- **Gas:** Minimal, paid by the actor who triggers each action (buyer for buy/bid, seller for list/cancel).

## Receipts & provenance

- Every transfer emits standard ERC-721/1155 events for clear on-chain provenance.  
- Item pages display **chain tx links** for verification on the Electroneum explorer.  
- Your **Profile → Activity** shows a complete audit trail of buys, bids, and offers.

---

## Trust & safety

- **Non-custodial.** We never hold your keys or NFTs.  
- **Escrowed funds.** Auction and offer balances live in the marketplace contract until finalization or release.  
- **Verification.** Favor verified collections and check contract addresses in [References → Contract Addresses](/references/contract-addresses).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **“Insufficient funds / gas.”** Top up ETN and retry.  
- **“Approval required.”** Confirm the one-time token approval and repeat your action.  
- **“Tx pending.”** Wait for chain finality or open the tx in the explorer from the item page.

If you hit a blocker, open **GitHub Issues** or ask in **Telegram** (links on the **Contact** page).
