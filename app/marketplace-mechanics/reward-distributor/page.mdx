# Reward Distributor

The Reward Distributor contract receives **1.5%** of every marketplace trade and makes those funds available to **Non-Fungible Comrades** holders on a **pro-rata** basis.

<Callout>
Settlement is on-chain and atomic: when a sale completes, the marketplace routes <strong>1.5%</strong> of the sale price to the Distributor, <strong>1.0%</strong> to the Panthart fee wallet, creator royalties (if any) to the collection recipient, and the remainder to the seller.
</Callout>

## High-level model

- **Accrual:** On each successful sale, the marketplace transfers **1.5%** of the sale price (in the listing currency: **ETN** or a supported **ERC-20**) into the Distributor.
- **Eligibility:** Any wallet holding **Non-Fungible Comrades** (ERC-721) is eligible to claim a share of the accrued balance.
- **Pro-rata share:** A holder’s claimable is proportional to the count of Comrades they hold relative to total supply at the time of accounting.
- **Self-custody:** Rewards are **never** auto-pulled. Holders claim from the contract when they choose.

## Claiming flow (holder experience)

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Hold Comrades:</strong> Keep your Non-Fungible Comrades in your wallet.</li>
    <li><strong>Accrue:</strong> As trades occur on Panthart, rewards accumulate in the Distributor contract.</li>
    <li><strong>Claim:</strong> Visit the claim UI (or call the contract) to withdraw your pro-rata rewards.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> New trades continue to add to your claimable balance over time.</li>
  </ol>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
If you transfer or sell your Comrades, future accrual reflects your new balance. Already-accrued but unclaimed rewards remain associated with your address per the accounting logic.
</Callout>

## Example math

Let:
- Total Comrades supply = **10,000**
- Your balance = **25**
- A sale of **1,000 ETN** occurs

Then:
- Distributor receives **1.5% × 1,000 = 15 ETN**
- Your instantaneous share of that sale = **(25 / 10,000) × 15 = 0.0375 ETN**

Over many sales (mixed ETN / ERC-20 listings), your **claimable per token** grows in each currency. You can claim per currency when it’s worth your gas.

---

## Multi-currency behavior

- Rewards accrue in the **same token** used for each sale (ETN or supported ERC-20s).
- Your account may have **parallel claimable balances** across multiple tokens.
- Claims withdraw the currency you select; there is **no auto-swap** between tokens.

---

## Administration

- The **Multisig Admin** (2-of-N) is authorized for protocol-level parameters exposed by the Distributor (e.g., epoch/window settings if applicable, operational toggles).
- Administrative actions are rare and recorded on-chain; addresses and roles are listed in **References → [Contract Addresses](/references/contract-addresses)**.

<Callout type="info">
The Distributor is <strong>not</strong> a custody wallet. Funds flow in automatically from marketplace settlements and flow out only via holder claims or authorized maintenance per contract design.
</Callout>

## Events & observability

Indexers and UIs track the following surfaces to keep dashboards and claim UIs accurate:

- **Accrual events** emitted by the marketplace (sale settled) and the Distributor (funds credited).
- **Claim events** emitted by the Distributor when a holder withdraws.
- **Supply & balances** from the Comrades ERC-721 for pro-rata calculations.

This event-driven model supports reorg-safe backfills and consistent “claimable now” views.

## Gas & timing tips

- **Batching:** If you hold multiple Comrades, claiming less frequently can amortize gas.
- **Token choice:** Claim when your **per-currency** balance is meaningful; wait on tiny residuals.
- **Wallet safety:** Always confirm the token and amount shown by the claim UI matches your expectation before signing.

---

## Guarantees

- **On-chain accounting:** No off-chain ledgers; all accruals and claims are verifiable on the explorer.
- **Non-custodial:** You keep your NFTs and only pull rewards when you call `claim`.
- **Deterministic payouts:** Pro-rata shares depend only on on-chain state (supply, balances, and accrued totals).
