# Listing & Auctions

Turn your NFTs into live marketplace inventory with **fixed-price** listings or **timed auctions**.  
Panthart is non-custodial: your wallet signs; the marketplace settles on-chain.

<Callout type="info">
**Fees & royalties at a glance:** each completed sale settles creator royalties (if configured) and a **2.5% marketplace fee**  
(**1.5% → Reward Distributor**, **1% → Panthart**). Currencies supported: **ETN** (native) and selected **ERC-20s**.

  ## Fixed-price listing

  Simple, instant purchases—best for liquid items and editions.

  <Steps>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Set price & currency</strong> — choose <em>ETN</em> or a supported <em>ERC-20</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Approve once (ERC-20 only)</strong> — give the marketplace spend allowance for that token.</li>
      <li><strong>Confirm “List”</strong> — the NFT becomes buyable immediately.</li>
    </ol>
  </Steps>

  **Buyer experience**
  - Click **Buy now** → (first-time ERC-20 approval if needed) → confirm purchase.
  - Settlement is atomic: <em>NFT → buyer</em>, <em>proceeds/royalties/fees → recipients</em>.

  **Good to know**
  - **ERC-1155 editions:** pick quantity when listing (and buyers can choose quantity when purchasing).
  - **Edit price:** supported via safe relist under the hood; may cost a tiny gas update.
  - **Cancel listing:** allowed any time before sale; requires a small on-chain tx.

  ## Timed auction

  Maximize price discovery with on-chain bids and a clear end time.

  <Steps>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Set reserve price</strong> — optional; item won’t settle below this.</li>
      <li><strong>Choose duration</strong> — e.g. 24–72 hours; optional start time (schedule).</li>
      <li><strong>Create auction</strong> — approve once (if ERC-20) and confirm the auction tx.</li>
    </ol>
  </Steps>

  **Bidding rules**
  - Bids must be ≥ current bid + min increment (and ≥ reserve if set).
  - When outbid, a bidder’s escrow is **released automatically** by the contract.
  - Auctions can use **anti-sniping extensions** (optional), adding a few minutes for late bids.

  **Ending & settlement**
  - At end time (after any extensions), settlement transfers the NFT to the highest bidder and pays proceeds/royalties/fees.
  - Anyone can trigger settlement if the UI hasn’t yet (trustless finalization).

  **Cancelation**
  - You can cancel **only if there are no valid bids**.

## Multi-currency notes (ETN + ERC-20)

- **ETN:** direct list/sell—no approval step.  
- **ERC-20:** one-time **Approve** for each token you list in; after that, listing/selling in that token is a single tx.  
- **Proceeds:** withdraw and settle in the **same currency** as the listing/auction.

<Callout>
To adjust currencies, cancel and relist in your desired token so the UI and buyers see the correct denomination.

## Delisting, edits & inventory

- **Edit price** (fixed-price): supported via safe relist; tiny gas fee applies.  
- **Cancel listing/auction**: listings can be canceled anytime before sale; auctions only when there are **no valid bids**.  
- **Batch list (1155)**: list multiple editions at once with a single flow (where supported).  
- **Relist quickly**: canceled items stay visible in your **Profile → On sale** panel for fast relist.

---

## Visibility & trust

- **Verified collections** surface higher in discovery modules. Keep logos, banners, and descriptions tidy.  
- Each item links to the **Electroneum explorer** (contract + token ID) for on-chain verification.  
- Prefer **official** contract addresses (see **References → [Contract Addresses](/references/contract-addresses)**).

---

## Safety checklist (sellers)

- Double-check the **spender** address in any ERC-20 approval—it should be the **official marketplace contract**.  
- If using a **Multisig** for admin/treasury, ensure the listing/withdrawal is initiated by the Multisig with the required signatures.  
- Never sign blind messages from strangers; the site will never ask for your seed phrase.

## Troubleshooting

**“My listing isn’t visible.”**  
Wait for block finality and refresh. Ensure you’re on the public collection view (not just your profile).

**“Price edit didn’t update.”**  
Edits may relist under the hood. If a race occurred (someone bought during edit), your tx will revert safely.

**“Can’t cancel auction.”**  
One or more valid bids exist; the contract blocks cancelation. You can still complete settlement at end time.

**“Wrong currency shown.”**  
Cancel and relist in your intended token. Buyers will only see and pay in the listing currency.
