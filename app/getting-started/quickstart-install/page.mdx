# Quickstart

<Callout type="info">
Panthart runs on <strong>Electroneum EVM</strong>. Confirm your wallet network and verify contract addresses in
<strong> References → <a href="/references/contract-addresses">Contract Addresses</a></strong> before signing anything.
</Callout>

---

## 5-minute flow

<Steps>

### 1) Install a wallet
Use <strong>MetaMask</strong> or another EVM-compatible wallet (Ledger/Trezor via MetaMask also works).

### 2) Connect
Open Panthart and click <em>Connect Wallet</em>. Your wallet may prompt to switch to <strong>Electroneum EVM</strong>.

### 3) Sanity-check (read-only)
Visit a collection or item page to ensure UI data loads for you (no signing required).  
This confirms RPC/indexing are healthy for your connection.

### 4) Mint (creators)
Choose a flow: <strong>721 Drop</strong>, <strong>Single 721</strong>, or <strong>Single 1155</strong>.  
Upload media + metadata. A small <strong>creation fee</strong> covers IPFS pinning/service; normal network <strong>gas</strong> applies.

### 5) List for sale
Pick <em>Fixed Price</em> or <em>Auction</em>. First time, your wallet will request a one-time <code>approve</code> for the marketplace (and for any ERC-20 you list in).

</Steps>

## What to expect (UX cheatsheet)

- <strong>Listings & auctions:</strong> Settlement is non-custodial and atomic: fees/royalties route to recipients; NFT and proceeds exchange in one transaction.  
- <strong>Multi-currency:</strong> Listing currency = settlement currency (ETN or supported ERC-20).  
- <strong>Royalties:</strong> Honored at settlement when the collection defines a royalty policy.  
- <strong>Rewards:</strong> 1.5% of each sale flows to the <em>Reward Distributor</em> for Non-Fungible Comrades holders.

<Callout>
First-time ERC-20 usage requires <code>approve</code>. You can revoke approvals later from your wallet if desired.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning">
If a transaction fails, check:<br/>
• Network = <strong>Electroneum EVM</strong><br/>
• Sufficient gas balance in the right token<br/>
• No pending nonce conflicts (speed up / cancel stuck tx)<br/>
• Spender/contract addresses match <a href="/references/contract-addresses">Contract Addresses</a>
</Callout>

- <strong>Approval loops:</strong> Your wallet may ask for an ERC-20 approval the first time you list in that token. This is normal—approve once, then list.  
- <strong>Indexer lag:</strong> A fresh mint/list may take a short moment to appear in all views; on-chain state is the source of truth.  
- <strong>Revoking approvals:</strong> You can revoke old spend allowances from your wallet’s token approval manager whenever you like.
